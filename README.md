## Usage

To install and use the AddressFinder Widget control within your Dynamics 365 or CDS instance, follow these steps...

### Installation

1. Download the [latest release](https://github.com/ryanmichaeljames/pcf-addressfinder-widget/releases/latest).
2. Import the solution `AddressFinderWidget_x_x_managed.zip` file into your Dynamics 365 or CDS instance.
3. Add the `AddressFinder Widget` control to the desired entity form.
4. Add your AddressFinder API key to the `API Key` property. If you don't already have an API key you can register for a free account that gives you 500 free lookups a month.

> There is a know issue where you cannot map account and contact address attributes to a PCF control's properties. Until this issue is resolved by Microsoft you can use the **FormXml Manager** plugin in the [XrmToolBox](https://www.xrmtoolbox.com) to map the address attributes to the AddressFinder Widget control's properties. See [Binding to Address Fields in a PCF Control](https://www.magnetismsolutions.com/blog/jaredjohnson/2019/07/04/binding-to-address-fields-in-a-pcf-control).
